CONNECTIVITY ISSUES FOUND
================================================================================

CRITICAL - DIRECTIONAL MISMATCH:
  [TB] Teleport Booth -> sesame_street_north
    - Teleport Booth has EXIT: south -> sesame_street_north
    - Northern End has EXIT: east -> teleport_booth
    - PROBLEM: You exit SOUTH from booth but it's EAST of Northern End
    - EXPECTED: Either booth should be "west" or Northern End should be "west"
    - CURRENT: Going south from booth, you cannot return via going north
    - FIX NEEDED: Change sesame_street_north exit to "west" or booth to "west"

All other connections are bidirectional and spatially consistent.
