  "description": "The store interior radiates an almost weaponized coziness, with wooden shelves stacked floor to ceiling with everything from birdseed to broadswords. A brass bell above the door jingles cheerfully whenever someone enters, having long since achieved sentience and a disturbing enthusiasm for its job. The scent of fresh cookies mingles with machine oil and existential dread in a way that somehow works.",
