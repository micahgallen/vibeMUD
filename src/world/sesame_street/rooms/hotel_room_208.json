  "description": "The room welcomes you with aggressive cheerfulness. Every surface has been decorated with motivational quotes in curly script: 'Live Laugh Love' over the bed, 'Dream Big' on the bathroom mirror, 'Seize the Day' above the dresser. Throw pillows multiply across the bed like enthusiastic rabbits, each proclaiming a different inspiring message. The curtains are aggressively floral, the kind of pattern that makes you consider photosynthesis. A diffuser on the nightstand emits a scent labeled 'Tranquil Optimism' that smells like artificial vanilla had an argument with lavender. It's the kind of room that really, really wants you to have a good time whether you're ready or not.",

    "quotes": "Inspirational messages assault you from every angle. Even the bathroom has one: 'You're Beautiful Just The Way You Are' faces you while you sit on the toilet.",
    "pillows": "Seven decorative pillows must be removed before you can access the actual sleeping pillows. This is apparently someone's idea of luxury.",
    "diffuser": "Burbles away, releasing 'Tranquil Optimism' into the air with the determination of a scent that believes in itself.",
    "curtains": "Roses the size of dinner plates bloom across fabric thick enough to double as emergency shelter. They keep out light and possibly radio waves."
