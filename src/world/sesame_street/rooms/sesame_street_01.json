  "description": "You stand at the heart of Sesame Street, where the pavement radiates an almost aggressive friendliness. The sun shines with the dedication of someone being paid overtime. A general store beckons to the east with promises of commerce, while to the west, a tavern offers refuge from sobriety. The street continues both north and south, maintaining its commitment to being relentlessly pleasant.",
