  "description": "The street reaches its northern terminus, where the relentless cheerfulness begins to waver at the edges. A bright red telephone booth stands to the east like a portal to anywhere else, its chrome gleaming with promises of escape and adventure. To the north, the pavement transitions from optimistic yellow brick to something darker and more honest - the entrance to Reality Street, where Sesame Street's facade finally admits defeat. The buildings seem to lean in conspiratorially, as if warning you about what lies ahead.",
