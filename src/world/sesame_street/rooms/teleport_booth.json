  "description": "Inside the cramped booth, the walls are papered with faded destination cards showing exotic locales: 'Springfield - Home of the Whopper!', 'Florida - Where Dreams Go to Sweat', 'Texas - Everything's Bigger (Especially the Ego)'. The telephone handset dangles from a cord that defies physics, humming with barely contained dimensional energy. A small placard reads 'Insert Quest Token or Dial 1-800-ELSEWHERE'.",
