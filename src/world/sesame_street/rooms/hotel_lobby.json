  "description": "The lobby achieves heights of aggressive comfort with overstuffed armchairs that seem to have opinions about your posture. A reception desk of suspicious grandeur dominates the room, staffed by a brass bell that expects you to work for your service. Faded photographs on the walls show previous guests, all smiling with the desperate intensity of people trying to convince themselves they're having a good time.",

    "desk": "The reception desk looms with dark mahogany authority and brass fittings. Behind it, a wall of cubbyholes holds room keys on brass tags, each one waiting for its next victim.",
    "photographs": "Black and white photos in tarnished frames show guests from decades past. They're all smiling, but their eyes have that thousand-yard stare. In every photo, if you look closely, the same bellhop appears in the background. He hasn't aged."
