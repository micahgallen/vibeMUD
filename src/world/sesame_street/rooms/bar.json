  "description": "The tavern manages to be simultaneously wholesome and questionable, with sticky tables that have witnessed a thousand philosophical debates and probably a few minor crimes. Peanut shells crunch underfoot with satisfying authority. The bar itself is a magnificent slab of oak that could double as a life raft or a shield wall, currently serving its more important purpose of dispensing liquid courage and regret. Behind the bar, bottles of varying repute line shelves that look one sneeze away from collapse. A chalkboard lists the drinks and snacks available. A narrow staircase descends to the south, from which emanate sounds of enthusiastic combat and the occasional triumphant (or defeated) 'wump.'",
