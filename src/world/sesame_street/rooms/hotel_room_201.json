  "description": "The room presents itself with all the enthusiasm of a Monday morning. A queen bed dominates the space, its quilt featuring a pattern of interlocking rings that might represent Olympic aspirations or just circles having a meeting. The nightstand holds a lamp with a shade slightly askew, casting light at an angle that suggests philosophical questioning. A dresser squats against one wall with drawers that stick just enough to make you work for your socks. The whole affair smells faintly of industrial-strength cleaning products and previous occupants' dreams.",

    "bed": "The mattress achieves a firmness that could be described as 'educational.' The pillows, meanwhile, have strong opinions about neck support.",
    "nightstand": "Particle board pretending to be wood, with a drawer containing a Gideon Bible and a takeout menu from 1987.",
    "dresser": "Five drawers of varying cooperation levels. The third one down requires a specific wiggling technique known only to past guests.",
    "tv": "A television of uncertain vintage sits in the corner, its remote control sticky for reasons you don't want to investigate."
