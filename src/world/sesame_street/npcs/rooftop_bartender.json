  "description": "Victor stands behind the mahogany bar with the quiet confidence of someone who has heard every story twice and believes none of them. His vest is pressed to perfection, his bow tie sits at exactly 90 degrees, and his cocktail shaker moves with the precision of a surgeon. Silver hair swept back, eyes that miss nothing, and hands that can pour three drinks simultaneously while maintaining eye contact. He's the kind of bartender who knows what you need before you do, and judges you only slightly for it.",
