  "description": "A martini with delusions of grandeur, made with both gin AND vodka because apparently one clear spirit isn't enough. A thin curl of lemon peel twists on the surface like it's posing for a magazine. This is the drink of someone who introduces themselves with their full name and expects you to remember it. Shaken, not stirred, naturally.",
