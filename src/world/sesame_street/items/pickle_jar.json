  "description": "Fished straight from the giant jar behind the bar, this pickle is the size of a small baseball bat and probably just as effective as a weapon. It's sour, it's crunchy, it's swimming in brine, and it pairs surprisingly well with beer. The bartender charges you for it anyway despite the 'help yourself' sign.",
