  "description": "This violently purple cocktail was either mixed by a professional bartender or someone who really likes the color purple and took a 'throw everything in and see what happens' approach. Small bubbles rise through the drink like tiny regrets ascending to freedom. It tastes like grape candy had a fistfight with a liquor store and everyone lost.",
