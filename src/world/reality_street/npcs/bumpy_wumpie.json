  "description": "A philosophically inclined wumpie with matted gray-brown fur and a nose that's seen better decades. He's wrapped in what might have once been a respected business suit, now transformed through mysterious alchemical processes into something that could qualify as abstract art. A mostly-empty bottle of 'Night Train' - the beverage equivalent of existential dread - dangles from one paw. His eyes have that faraway look of someone contemplating either the meaning of existence or trying to remember where he left his other shoe. He sways gently even when sitting still, like a furry metronome set to 'melancholy.' A faded name tag reads 'ASSISTANT REGIONAL MANAGER' from a company that definitely doesn't exist anymore.",
