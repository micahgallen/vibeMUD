  "description": "A disheveled wumpie with fur that looks like it hasn't been groomed since the Bush administration - the first one. His eyes dart nervously in every direction at once, a feat that seems to defy basic biology. He's wearing a stained oversized hoodie with the logo of a band that broke up in 1993, and his paws twitch constantly as if operating an invisible Game Boy. A faint aroma of desperation and discount energy drinks follows him around. Every few seconds he glances over his shoulder at absolutely nothing, muttering to himself about 'the man' and 'good stuff.' Despite his attempt at menace, he's still fundamentally adorable in that tragic-stuffed-animal sort of way.",
