  "description": "Twitchy earned his name through a combination of genuine neurological issues and what appears to be chronic overcaffeination from pecking at discarded energy drink cans. His head snaps left and right at random intervals, his left wing has a constant tremor, and one leg kicks out periodically as if trying to shake off an invisible bug. He's a mottled brown pigeon with wild, staring eyes that never quite focus on the same thing, and several feathers permanently stick straight up like he's been electrocuted. His beak clicks compulsively - click-click-click - even when he's not eating. Both feet are intact but curl and uncurl rhythmically, making him look like he's perpetually kneading invisible dough. There's a streak of what might be dried coffee down his chest, and he vibrates slightly even when standing still. His movements are jerky and unpredictable, making him both unsettling and oddly fascinating to watch.",
