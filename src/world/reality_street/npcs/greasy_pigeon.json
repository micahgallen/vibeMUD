  "description": "This pigeon looks like he fell into a vat of motor oil and just decided to lean into it. Every feather glistens with an oily sheen that creates rainbow patterns in the light - beautiful in a deeply unsettling way. He leaves small grease spots wherever he lands, and there's an actual visible drip trail following him as he waddles. One leg is significantly shorter than the other, giving him a rolling, sailor-like gait that's hypnotic to watch. His eyes have a slightly manic gleam, possibly from huffing whatever he's covered in. Small bits of trash - a cigarette filter, part of a straw wrapper, something that might be tinfoil - are stuck to various parts of his body, creating an avant-garde sculpture of urban decay. He smells like a parking garage.",
