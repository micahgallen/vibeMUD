  "description": "The western section of Reality Street continues here, bordered by establishments that have learned to coexist with economic uncertainty. To the west, a pawn shop displays its wares behind security glass that suggests experience has been an expensive teacher. A hand-painted sign advertises 'CASH 4 GOLD' with the kind of enthusiasm that comes from desperation meeting opportunity. The shop's window is a museum of other people's former treasures - guitars, jewelry, electronics, each item telling a story of need outweighing sentimentality. To the east, Highland Park remains accessible through the fence. The street runs north and south.",
