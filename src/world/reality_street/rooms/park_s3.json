  "description": "The south-central portion of Highland Park continues here with a mixture of planned space and natural reclamation. A concrete pad that might have once been a basketball court or picnic area now serves as whatever people need it to be - hopscotch grid chalk-drawn by optimistic children, skateboard practice ground judging by the scrape marks, or just a flat surface in a world that's mostly hills and potholes. Around its edges, grass has begun pushing through cracks in determined green fingers, suggesting that concrete's victory was always temporary. A park bench nearby leans at an angle that makes sitting an adventure in applied physics. The park continues north, east, and west, while south leads toward Reality Street.",
