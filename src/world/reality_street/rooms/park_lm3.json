  "description": "The central eastern section of Highland Park spreads around you, offering a view west toward the fountain that serves as this space's gravitational center. The grass here has been worn into patterns by feet - paths radiating from the fountain like spokes on a wheel, evidence of human traffic that followed desire rather than design. A park bench sits here, its green paint faded to a color that might be called 'institutional jade' or 'municipal exhaustion.' Someone has carved 'MIKE + SARAH 4EVER' into the backrest, though whether Mike and Sarah achieved their forever is lost to time. The park continues in all directions.",
