  "description": "The central eastern portion of Highland Park continues here, where the space transitions from the fountain area toward the park's eastern edge. The grass shows the kind of resilient growth that speaks to being largely left alone - not manicured, not destroyed, just... existing in that middle ground where nature and neglect have reached an understanding. To the east, a gate in the chain-link fence provides the main eastern entrance to the park, leading out to Reality Street. A few scattered items tell stories of recent use - a forgotten frisbee lodged in a tree branch, a paperback book swollen from rain exposure, a single sneaker that raises more questions than it answers. The park continues in multiple directions.",
