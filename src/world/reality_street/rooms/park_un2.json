  "description": "The upper central section of Highland Park opens up here, offering a view toward what appears to be the park's heart - you can glimpse a structure to the south that might be a fountain, monument, or architectural surrender to gravity, depending on perspective and optimism level. The grass here shows signs of use - paths worn by feet, patches where picnic blankets have compressed the earth, circles where someone once started but didn't finish landscaping project. A discarded newspaper flutters past, its headlines already ancient history. The park continues in all cardinal directions, each promising its own variation on urban green space.",
