  "description": "The central western section of Highland Park opens up here with a view toward the park's most prominent feature - to the east, you can clearly see a fountain that has passed through functional, decorative, and is now approaching 'architectural archaeology.' The area around you shows the kind of wear that speaks to this being a throughway - grass trampled into dirt paths, evidence that people cut across here rather than following whatever route the planners intended. To the west, a gate in the chain-link fence provides the main western entrance to the park, leading out to Reality Street. The park continues in multiple directions, all offering variations on urban green space theme.",
