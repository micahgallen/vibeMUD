  "description": "The upper eastern section of Highland Park stretches here toward the border with Reality Street, visible to the east through the deteriorating chain-link fence. This area shows signs of teenage occupation - a makeshift skateboard ramp constructed from plywood and hope leans against a tree, its surface decorated with stickers and graffiti declaring allegiance to bands that may or may not still exist. Empty soda cans have been arranged in a pyramid with more care than they probably deserved. A basketball without much air left in it sits forlornly beneath a tree, as if waiting for someone to remember it exists. The park continues west and south.",
