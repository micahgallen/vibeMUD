  "description": "The alley commits more fully to its aesthetic here. The pavement has developed artistic cracks that suggest a municipal budget with competing priorities. Cardboard boxes have been arranged with the careful deliberation of someone creating either a bedroom or a statement about housing policy - possibly both. The walls are tagged with symbols that either mean something profound or were drawn by someone who found a spray can and an opinion. A puddle reflects the sky with more optimism than the surroundings warrant. The alley continues east deeper into shadow, while west leads back toward the fading light of Sesame Street.",
