    "description":  "Great Scott! You\u0027re standing before the BiffCo Tower \u0026 Casino, a gaudy, neon-drenched monument to bad taste that scrapes the smog-filled sky. It\u0027s the kind of place that makes you feel like you\u0027ve taken a wrong turn somewhere in time. Owned by none other than Hill Valley\u0027s number one bully, Biff Tannen, this place is the rotten core of his empire. The hum of electricity and the distant sound of slot machines create a constant, unsettling buzz. This has to be it... Biff\u0027s headquarters. But getting in? That\u0027s a whole other problem.",
