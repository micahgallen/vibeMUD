  "description": "A formidable concrete structure spanning a deep chasm, named after a tragedy. The Clayton Ravine Bridge stands as a testament to municipal engineering, a stark concrete ribbon stretched across the yawning maw of Clayton Ravine. Local legend, the kind whispered by bored teenagers and gossipy old-timers, claims the ravine is named for a schoolteacher who took a rather unfortunate and final plunge a century ago. Below, the river glints with a deceptive innocence, far from the mundane concerns of Hill Valley. To the east, the weary end of Main Street awaits.",
