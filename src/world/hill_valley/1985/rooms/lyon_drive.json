  "description": "A worn stretch of road, connecting the weary ends of Hill Street and Hubbard Avenue. Lyon Drive, once a symbol of suburban expansion, now shows the subtle signs of neglect. The asphalt is cracked in places, and weeds bravely push through the fissures, a quiet rebellion against the concrete. To the north, the entrance to Lyon Estates looms, a monument to a dream that has settled into comfortable, if slightly faded, reality. The air is a blend of distant traffic and the faint, lingering scent of exhaust fumes, a testament to the relentless march of time.",
