    "description":  "The bustling heart of Hill Valley, where time seems to stand still, quite literally, with the grand courthouse clock perpetually frozen at 10:04 PM. Surrounding the square are quaint, historic shops, each holding a whisper of the past, and perhaps, a secret or two. You can almost hear the faint echo of a skateboard, or the distant rumble of a souped-up DeLorean.",
