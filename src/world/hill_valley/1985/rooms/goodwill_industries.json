  "description": "A repository of forgotten dreams and gently used necessities. Goodwill Industries is a treasure trove of forgotten dreams and gently used necessities, a place where the detritus of one person's life becomes another's potential treasure. Racks of clothes, shelves of mismatched dinnerware, and a corner filled with dusty electronics create a unique aroma of mothballs and possibility, a scent that speaks of countless untold stories. A few shoppers, with the determined glint of prospectors, rummage through the offerings, hoping to find a hidden gem amidst the flotsam and jetsam of consumer culture. The only exit is back out to Main St., where the cycle of acquisition and disposal continues.",
