  "description": "The final stretch of Lyon Estates Street before it curves into a cul-de-sac. The houses, though still 1950s in origin, show a touch more individuality, as if the residents dared to express themselves within the confines of suburban conformity, only to find their efforts subtly undermined by the relentless march of time. A lone, slightly overgrown rose bush struggles to bloom in front of one house, a small act of defiance against the perfectly manicured lawns that are now, perhaps, a little less perfect. The air is still, heavy with the unspoken stories of decades of family life, a soundtrack to a dream that has settled into comfortable, if slightly worn, reality. To the south, the street continues its journey through Lyon Estates, and to the north, the cul-de-sac awaits.",
