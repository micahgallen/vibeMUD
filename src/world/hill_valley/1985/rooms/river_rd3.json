  "description": "A secluded stretch of River Road, where the sounds of civilization are almost entirely absent. You are on River Road, a place where the distant hum of traffic has faded into a whisper, replaced by the chirping of unseen insects and the gentle rustle of leaves. The road here is barely maintained, with cracks and potholes hinting at a forgotten past. The air is fresh, carrying the clean scent of pine and damp earth, a brief respite from the urban decay. At a glance: A peaceful, almost forgotten, stretch of River Road.",
