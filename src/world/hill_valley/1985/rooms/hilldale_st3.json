  "description": "The final stretch of Hilldale Street before it curves into a cul-de-sac. You are on the last straight segment of Hilldale Street, where the houses begin to hint at a slight variation in their architectural perfection, as if the builders ran out of identical blueprints. A lone, perfectly spherical topiary stands guard at the entrance to a cul-de-sac, a silent sentinel of suburban order. The air is still, broken only by the distant, almost imperceptible hum of central air conditioning units. To the west, the street continues its journey through Hilldale, and to the east, the cul-de-sac awaits.",
