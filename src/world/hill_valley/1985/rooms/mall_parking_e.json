  "description": "The eastern side of the parking lot, closest to the main entrance. This area is slightly less desolate, with a few more cars and a designated 'expectant mothers' parking spot that has clearly been used by a monster truck. A faded sign points towards the mall entrance, its cheerful font a stark contrast to the general air of malaise.",
