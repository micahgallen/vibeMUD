  "description": "The northern end of Hubbard Avenue, intersecting with Main Street. You are on Hubbard Ave, at the intersection with Main St. To the north, Main St stretches out, a ribbon of fading commerce. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the south, a testament to suburban sprawl. To the east, the tantalizing aroma of barbecue wafts from Elmo's Rib Cafe, a beacon of greasy hope. The air is a blend of distant traffic and the faint, lingering scent of suburban dreams.",
