    "description":  "The Texaco Station, a gleaming beacon of 1980s automotive service, where friendly attendants in crisp uniforms still offer to clean your windshield and check your oil. The air hums with the gentle thrum of pumps and the occasional squeal of tires. It\u0027s a place where you might pull up in a beat-up truck, or perhaps a time-traveling sports car, and receive the same impeccable service, a true relic of a bygone era of personalized care.",
