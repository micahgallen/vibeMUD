  "description": "Holts Diner is less a building and more a temporal anomaly, a pocket universe where the coffee is always lukewarm, the pie is always apple, and the gossip is always, always, about someone else. The air is thick with the ghosts of a thousand conversations, the clatter of cutlery, and the faint, existential dread of another Tuesday morning. Here, the universe conspires to ensure that every local secret, no matter how mundane or utterly devastating, will eventually find its way onto a Formica tabletop. It is the beating, greasy heart of Hill Valley.",
