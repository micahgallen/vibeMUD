  "description": "The main entrance to Lyon Estates, a sprawling suburban development that has seen better decades. The once-pristine lawns now show patches of crabgrass, and the houses, built in the late 50s, wear their age with a comfortable, if slightly weary, resignation. A pair of weathered lion statues, their white paint chipped and faded, guard the entrance, silent sentinels to a dream that has settled into mundane reality. To the south, Lyon Drive stretches out, a ribbon of cracked asphalt leading back to the main thoroughfares. To the north, the labyrinth of Lyon Estates beckons, a testament to comfortable, if uninspired, domesticity.",
