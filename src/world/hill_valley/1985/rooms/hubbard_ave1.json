  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, dotted with small apartment buildings. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is mostly residential, with a few small apartment buildings that seem to have been dropped here as an afterthought. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to suburban sprawl. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
