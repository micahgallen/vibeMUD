  "description": "A dimly lit bar where secrets are currency and the drinks are strong enough to make you forget your own name. Gaynor's Hideaway is less a bar and more a collective agreement to ignore the outside world. The air is thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the kind of quiet desperation that only a Tuesday night can inspire. A few solitary figures are hunched over the bar, their faces illuminated by the sickly glow of a jukebox that seems to only play songs about regret. The bartender, a man who has seen it all and is profoundly unimpressed, polishes a glass with a rag that has seen better decades.",
