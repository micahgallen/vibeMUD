  "description": "A quiet, unassuming place where the residents are, by and large, extremely quiet. Oak Park Cemetery is a place where the residents are, by and large, extremely quiet and have very few complaints. The old stone markers, weathered by the relentless march of time and the occasional pigeon, stand as silent testimonials to lives lived, loved, and ultimately, concluded. The oaks, ancient and wise, cast long, dappled shadows, providing a sense of peace that is both profound and utterly meaningless in the grand cosmic scheme of things. It's a good place for contemplation, or for hiding from Biff, depending on your immediate needs.",
