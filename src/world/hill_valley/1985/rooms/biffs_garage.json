  "description": "A monument to automotive entropy and questionable life choices. Biff's Garage is less a place for automotive repair and more a museum dedicated to the principle of entropy. Tools, car parts, and mysterious greasy objects lie scattered in a way that suggests a small, localized Big Bang occurred and no one bothered to clean up. The air smells of ozone, regret, and cheap cigars, a heady mix that promises both mechanical failure and a headache. The 'reputation' it has is the sort that is spoken in hushed tones, usually involving phrases like 'I'm sure it'll buff out' and 'that'll be extra.' Biff's presence is a random, unpleasant variable, like a sudden rainstorm or a tax audit, only with more yelling.",
