    "description":  "The Twin Pines Mall, a sprawling monument to consumerism, gleams under the Hill Valley sky. Its bright neon signs hum with an electric energy, illuminating a vast parking lot that seems to stretch to the horizon. This isn\u0027t just any mall; it\u0027s a place where dreams are bought and sold, where teenagers loiter, and where, under the cloak of night, extraordinary events involving plutonium, a DeLorean, and a bolt of lightning might just unfold. Or perhaps, it\u0027s the Lone Pine Mall now, depending on how history played out.",
