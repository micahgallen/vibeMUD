  "description": "Another segment of Lyon Estates Street, where the houses, while still distinctly 1950s, are slightly larger, hinting at a subtle hierarchy of suburban success that has, perhaps, not quite panned out. A few children's bicycles lie abandoned on a lawn, their colors faded, a fleeting splash of melancholy against the muted tones of the neighborhood. The air is still, broken only by the distant chirping of birds and the occasional, almost apologetic, bark of a dog, a soundtrack to a dream that has settled into comfortable, if slightly worn, reality. To the south and north, the street continues its quiet journey through this middle-class haven.",
