  "description": "An expanse of organized dirt, stretching towards a receding horizon. You have reached the Farmland, an area whose primary export is scenery, and whose secondary export is existential dread. Fields, which are mostly just organized dirt, stretch out to a horizon that seems to be actively receding, as if it has better places to be. The farmhouses are punctuation marks in a long, rambling sentence about corn, each one a testament to a life of quiet toil. Occasionally, a tractor will rumble past, a lumbering, diesel-powered beast of burden from a species that long ago decided that four wheels were better than two legs. It's all very peaceful, in a 'nothing is ever going to happen here' sort of way, which is precisely when things tend to happen.",
