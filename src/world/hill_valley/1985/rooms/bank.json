  "description": "The Hill Valley Bank stands as a monument to the decidedly peculiar idea that little green pieces of paper are worth more than, say, a good sandwich or a sturdy pair of boots. Its doors, heavy with the crushing weight of financial responsibility, open into a room where perfectly ordinary people in ties perform the solemn ritual of moving imaginary numbers from one ledger to another. The tellers are polite in the way a guillotine is efficient.",
