  "description": "A quiet street in Lyon Estates, lined with well-worn 1950s homes. The houses, built in the late 50s, now exude a comfortable, if slightly faded, charm. Lawns are mostly green, but the occasional patch of crabgrass or a slightly leaning fence hints at the quiet battles fought against entropy. A forgotten tricycle lies on its side in one yard, a silent testament to a childhood that has moved on. The air is still, carrying the faint scent of blooming flowers and the distant, almost imperceptible hum of suburban life, a soundtrack to a dream that has settled into comfortable reality. To the south, the main entrance to Lyon Estates beckons, while to the north, the street continues its gentle curve.",
