  "description": "A quiet cul-de-sac, the peaceful heart of Lyon Estates. You find yourself in a quiet cul-de-sac, the peaceful heart of Lyon Estates, where the houses, all built in the late 1950s, face inward, creating a sense of insular community. A faded 'Welcome to Lyon Estates' sign, slightly askew, stands at the center, a relic from a more optimistic era. The air is still, broken only by the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant, almost mournful, cry of a lonely ice cream truck. To the south, the main Lyon Estates Street offers the only way out of this loop of comfortable, if slightly melancholic, domesticity.",
