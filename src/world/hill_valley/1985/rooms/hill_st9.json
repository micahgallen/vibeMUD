  "description": "The abrupt end of Hill Street, where civilization gives way to wilderness. You are at the southern end of Hill St. The road ends here, not with a flourish, but with a whimper, giving way to a dense forest that begins just beyond the last cracked asphalt. Hill St continues its weary journey to the north, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
