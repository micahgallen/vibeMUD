  "description": "This is not so much a lot as a statement by nature that it will, eventually, win. Weeds and un-neighborly trees have reclaimed the space where a mansion once dared to exist, a building that, according to local legend, burned down for reasons that probably involved insurance and an unhealthy amount of temporal paradoxes. The rumors aren't just strange; they're the kind of baroque, multi-generational gossip that small towns cultivate like prize-winning orchids. They say you can still hear the faint echo of a man yelling 'Great Scott!' if you stand here at the right time, which is usually after you've had a few drinks at Holts Diner.",
