  "description": "A narrow, garbage-strewn alley that smells of damp cardboard and regret. The brick walls are covered in a tapestry of faded graffiti, and a single, flickering bulb in a wire cage does a poor job of illuminating the shadows. A stray cat hisses from atop a dented dumpster before disappearing into the gloom. It's the kind of place where you wouldn't want to drop your keys, or your guard.",
