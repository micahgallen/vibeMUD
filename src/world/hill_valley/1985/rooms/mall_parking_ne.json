  "description": "The northeast corner of the parking lot, where the asphalt begins to crack. Weeds poke through the fissures in the pavement, a quiet rebellion against the concrete expanse. A single, flickering lamp post casts a sickly yellow glow, even during the day. The distant hum of the mall's air conditioning units is the only sound.",
