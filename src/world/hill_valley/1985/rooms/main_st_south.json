  "description": "Main Street (South) is where the town's aspirations for quaintness begin to unravel, replaced by the grim realities of commerce and storage. It's the part of town that smells faintly of diesel, forgotten dreams, and the existential angst of inanimate objects waiting to be shipped. The warehouses stand like silent, brick-faced sentinels, guarding secrets that are probably just old furniture and seasonal decorations. This is where things go to be put away, perhaps forever.",
