      "description": "A central block of Main Street, a mix of adult entertainment, bail bonds, and quick cash. You are on Main St, roughly in the middle of the block. To the east and west, the street stretches out, with storefronts on either side. Several businesses line this stretch, including the lurid glow of Cupid's Adult Bookstore, the grim facade of Abrams Brokerage Corporation, and the desperate promises of the Loan Shop. Interspersed among them are numerous empty storefronts, their dusty windows reflecting the slow exodus of commerce from the downtown area to the suburban mall on the outskirts of town. To the south, the Courthouse Square North Parking Lot sprawls, a testament to progress, or perhaps, a lack thereof.",
