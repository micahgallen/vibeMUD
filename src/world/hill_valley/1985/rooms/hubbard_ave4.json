  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, lined with older, two-story houses. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is lined with older, two-story houses, their paint slightly faded, their gardens a mix of well-tended and slightly overgrown. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to suburban sprawl. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
