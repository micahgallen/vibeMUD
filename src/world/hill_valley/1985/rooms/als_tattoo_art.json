  "description": "The buzz of a tattoo gun is the first thing you notice. Al's Tattoo Art is a small, slightly grimy parlor where questionable decisions are made permanent. The walls are covered in flash art—dragons, skulls, and the occasional poorly-rendered portrait of a rock star. The air smells of antiseptic, ink, and the faint, metallic tang of regret. Al, a large man with more tattoos than visible skin, looks up from his work, his eyes silently asking if you're here to make a mistake or just waste his time.",
