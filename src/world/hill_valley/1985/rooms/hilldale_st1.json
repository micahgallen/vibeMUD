  "description": "A pristine street in the heart of Hilldale. You are on a quiet, tree-lined street in Hilldale, where every house looks like it was plucked from the pages of a home decor magazine. The lawns are impossibly green, the cars in the driveways are impeccably clean, and the silence is almost deafening, broken only by the distant whir of an automatic sprinkler system. It's the kind of place where nothing ever seems to go wrong, which, in Hill Valley, is usually a sign that something is about to. To the west, the entrance to Hilldale, and to the east, more of the same.",
