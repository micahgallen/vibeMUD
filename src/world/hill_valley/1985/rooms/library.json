    "description":  "A hushed sanctuary of knowledge, the Hill Valley Library stands as a testament to bygone eras. Rows upon rows of dusty tomes and ancient records line the shelves, each whispering tales from the town\u0027s very founding. You might half-expect to find a young George McFly poring over a sci-fi novel, or perhaps even a hidden compartment leading to a secret laboratory.",
