  "description": "First Street, despite its rather definitive name, is not actually the first street, nor is it particularly concerned with being first at anything. It's a modest thoroughfare, lined with shops that seem to exist in a state of perpetual, low-grade surprise that anyone actually walks in. The storefronts gaze blankly across at the square, like old men watching a particularly uninteresting game of chess. Here, the pursuit of commerce is less a roaring engine of capitalism and more a gentle hum of mild disappointment.",
