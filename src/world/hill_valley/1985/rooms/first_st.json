  "description": "A connecting street, bridging the gap between Hill and Hubbard. You are on First St, a utilitarian stretch of asphalt that serves as a vital, if uninspired, connector between the two main north-south arteries of Hill Valley. To the west, Hill St disappears into a residential haze, while to the east, First St continues its journey towards Hubbard Ave. To the north, the South Parking Lot of Courthouse Square looms, a stark reminder of what once was. To the south, the faded marquee of the Essex Theater promises a different kind of escape.",
