  "description": "A stretch of Main Street, facing the former courthouse, now the Department of Social Services. You are on Main St, standing before the grand, albeit chipped and stained, facade of what was once the Hill Valley Courthouse, now the Department of Social Services. The street continues to the east and west, a ribbon of fading commerce. The air is thick with the scent of exhaust and the faint, lingering aroma of civic decline.",
