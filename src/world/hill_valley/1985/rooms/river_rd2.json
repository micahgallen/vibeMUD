  "description": "A bend in River Road, offering a glimpse of the river itself, murky and indifferent. You are on River Road, where a slight curve in the asphalt reveals a sliver of the river, its waters a murky brown, flowing with an indifferent current. The trees grow thicker here, their branches forming a canopy that filters the harsh afternoon sun, casting long, dappled shadows on the road. The air is heavy with the scent of river water and decaying leaves, a poignant reminder of time's relentless passage.",
