  "description": "Main Street (West) is where the town attempts to put on a brave face, a thin veneer of 'progress' over the underlying existential dread. Here, boutiques peddle items of questionable necessity, a barber practices the ancient art of hair removal with a philosophical detachment, and small offices hum with the quiet desperation of paperwork. It's a place where people try to look busy, even when the universe has clearly indicated that their efforts are, at best, a charming distraction.",
