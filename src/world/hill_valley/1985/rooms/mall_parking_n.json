  "description": "The northern expanse of the mall's parking lot, a sea of asphalt under the indifferent sky. Faded yellow lines mark spaces for cars that are, for the most part, dented and slightly sad. A few rogue shopping carts stand abandoned, silent monuments to forgotten errands. The air smells of hot asphalt and the faint, sweet aroma of exhaust fumes.",
