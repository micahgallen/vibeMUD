  "description": "A bail bondsman's office, smelling faintly of desperation and stale coffee. The Abrams Brokerage Corporation office is a picture of 80s grit, where fluorescent lights hum over a cluttered desk. Behind a thick pane of bulletproof glass sits a burly man with a suspicious gaze, a silent arbiter of freedom for a price. The air conditioning is set to 'arctic blast,' doing little to dispel the faint scent of stale cigarettes and the unspoken anxieties of its clientele. This isn't about stocks; it's about getting people out of a bind, for a fee that always seems to be just out of reach.",
