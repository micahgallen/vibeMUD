  "description": "The southern edge of Hill Valley, where the town's middle-class dreams took root in the late 1950s. Lyon Estates is a sprawling suburban development, a testament to the post-war boom, where every house, built in the late 50s, now shows a comfortable weariness. Lawns are still mostly green, but the occasional patch of crabgrass or a slightly leaning fence hints at the quiet battles fought against entropy. To the west, the road leads towards the quieter, more established Hill Street. To the east, it connects to the familiar, if slightly less manicured, Hubbard Avenue. To the north, the heart of Lyon Estates beckons, a labyrinth of comfortable, if uninspired, domesticity.",
