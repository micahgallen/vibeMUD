    "description":  "Welcome to Lyon Estates, a picture-perfect slice of 1980s suburbia. Rows of identical tract homes, each with its manicured lawn and two-car garage, stretch out in a seemingly endless grid. This is the quintessential American dream, where every house looks the same, and every family has a station wagon. Somewhere within this meticulously planned landscape lies the humble abode of the McFly family, a place where ordinary lives are about to become anything but.",
