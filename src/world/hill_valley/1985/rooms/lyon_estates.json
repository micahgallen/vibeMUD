  "description": "A sprawling suburban development, a monument to conformity and quiet despair. Lyon Estates is a testament to the human desire for conformity, a sprawling suburban development where every house is a slightly different shade of beige, and every lawn is mowed to precisely the same height. It's a place where individuality goes to die a slow, comfortable death, replaced by the gentle hum of air conditioning units and the distant bark of a neighbor's dog. The McFly residence, a beacon of accidental historical significance, blends seamlessly into this tapestry of pleasant, predictable mediocrity. It's all very nice, and utterly terrifying, in a way only true suburban bliss can be.",
