  "description": "The ignominious end of Hubbard Avenue, blocked by a pungent obstacle. You are at the southern end of Hubbard Ave. The road ends here, not with a grand vista, but with a large, fragrant pile of manure, a subtle reminder of the agricultural roots Hill Valley pretends to have outgrown. Hubbard Ave continues its weary journey to the north, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is thick with the smell of the farm, a stark contrast to the suburban aspirations of the town.",
