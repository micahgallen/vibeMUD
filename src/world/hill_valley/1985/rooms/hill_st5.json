  "description": "An older, more established section of Hill Street, with well-tended gardens. You are on Hill St. The houses here are a bit older, with well-tended gardens that stubbornly resist the encroaching weariness of the neighborhood. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
