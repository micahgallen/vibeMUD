  "description": "A quiet cul-de-sac, the peaceful heart of Lyon Estates. You find yourself in a quiet cul-de-sac, the peaceful heart of Lyon Estates, where the brand new houses face inward, creating a sense of insular community. A brand new 'Welcome to Lyon Estates' sign stands at the center, a symbol of a bright new future. The air is still, broken only by the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant, cheerful cry of a Good Humor ice cream truck. To the south, the main Lyon Estates Street offers the only way out of this loop of comfortable, if slightly uniform, domesticity.",
