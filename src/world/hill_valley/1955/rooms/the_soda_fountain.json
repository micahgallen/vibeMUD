  "description": "A popular hangout for the youth of Hill Valley. The Soda Fountain is a cheerful, brightly lit shop with a long counter and a row of comfortable booths. The air is filled with the sweet scent of ice cream, syrup, and freshly made waffle cones. A jukebox in the corner plays the latest rock and roll hits, and a friendly soda jerk in a crisp white uniform is happy to whip up your favorite treat. This is a place of innocent fun, where friendships are made and memories are created.",
