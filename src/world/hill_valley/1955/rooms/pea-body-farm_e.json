  "description": "The eastern side of the Peabody farm, closest to the main road. This area is a bit more organized, with a neatly painted fence and a designated spot for the family's brand new pickup truck. A faded sign points towards the farmhouse, its cheerful font a testament to the family's pride in their land.",
