  "description": "A wide, tree-lined stretch of Eisenhower Drive. You are on Eisenhower Dr. The road is wide and tree-lined, a testament to the town's optimistic urban planning. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
