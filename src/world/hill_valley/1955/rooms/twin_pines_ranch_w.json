  "description": "The western side of the Twin Pines Ranch, a serene expanse of fields, patiently awaiting the Peabody family's next planting. A lone, sun-bleached scarecrow stands proudly in the middle of the field, its arms outstretched in a welcoming gesture, its button eyes gazing optimistically at the sky. It looks as though it has stood here since the dawn of time, a silent guardian of the ranch's enduring spirit.",
