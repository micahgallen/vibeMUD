  "description": "A residential stretch of Eisenhower Drive, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. You are on Eisenhower Dr. The street is mostly residential here, with a mix of architectural styles that speak of the town's growing prosperity. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
