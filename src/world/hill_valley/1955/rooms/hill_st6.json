  "description": "A quiet, almost serene stretch of Hill Street, far from the main thoroughfare. You are on Hill St. The sounds of distant traffic are muffled here, a welcome reprieve from the constant hum of modern life. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
