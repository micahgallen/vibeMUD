  "description": "A pillar of the community, the Bank of Hill Valley stands as a testament to the town's prosperity. The polished marble floors and high ceilings exude an air of quiet confidence. Friendly tellers in crisp uniforms greet you with a warm smile, and the bank manager is always ready to offer a word of advice or a sensible loan to a promising young entrepreneur. The air smells of old money, new opportunities, and the faint, reassuring scent of lemon polish.",
