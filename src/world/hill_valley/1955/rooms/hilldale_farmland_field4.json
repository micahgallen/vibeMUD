  "description": "A vast, circular field, once destined to be a cul-de-sac, now lies fallow, awaiting the spring planting. This is Hilldale Farmland (Field 4), a testament to the rich agricultural heritage of Hill Valley. The fertile earth, a deep, promising brown, stretches towards the horizon, reflecting the bright, optimistic sky. The air is still, heavy with the wholesome scent of rich soil and the unspoken promise of a bountiful harvest. To the west, a well-worn farm track offers the only path through this peaceful expanse.",
