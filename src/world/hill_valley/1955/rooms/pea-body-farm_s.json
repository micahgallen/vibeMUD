  "description": "The southern edge of the Peabody farm, bordering a dusty, unused field. The cornfields give way to dirt and weeds here. A sturdy 'No Trespassing' sign is posted on a wooden fence. The farmhouse seems distant from this vantage point, its welcoming porch light a tiny beacon in the vast expanse of the countryside.",
