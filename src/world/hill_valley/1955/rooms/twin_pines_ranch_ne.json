  "description": "The northeast corner of the Twin Pines Ranch, where the Peabody family's meticulously tilled fields gracefully give way to a small, enchanting patch of woods. A few wildflowers bravely poke through the grass, a quiet rebellion against the orderly rows of corn. A single, majestic oak tree casts a long, comforting shadow, even during the brightest day. The distant, contented moo of a cow is the only sound, a perfect harmony of nature and nurture.",
