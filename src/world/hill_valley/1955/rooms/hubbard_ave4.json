  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, lined with charming, two-story houses. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is lined with charming, two-story houses, their paint fresh and their gardens well-tended. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to the town's growing prosperity. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
