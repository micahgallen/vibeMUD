  "description": "A quiet, tree-lined residential street. You are on First St, a peaceful residential street where the houses are well-maintained and the lawns are perfectly manicured. The sound of children playing can be heard in the distance, and a friendly neighbor waves as you pass by. To the west, First St continues its journey towards the center of town, and to the east, it meets the equally charming Hubbard Ave. The air is filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and the faint, sweet smell of blooming flowers.",
