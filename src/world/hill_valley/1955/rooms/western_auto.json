  "description": "A wonderland of gleaming chrome and the smell of fresh rubber. Western Auto is a treasure trove for the modern man, offering everything from bicycles and auto parts to the latest in home appliances. Sunlight glints off the polished fenders of a brand-new Schwinn bicycle in the window display. The air is filled with the scent of new tires, motor oil, and the boundless optimism of the post-war boom. A friendly clerk in a crisp, white shirt is happy to help you find just what you need to keep your life running smoothly.",
