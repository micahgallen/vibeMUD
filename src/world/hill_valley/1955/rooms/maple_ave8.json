  "description": "A more spacious, rural stretch of Maple Avenue. You are on Maple Ave. The houses are more spread out here, with larger yards that hint at a less crowded existence. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
