  "description": "Maple Avenue transitions from suburban to a more rural landscape. You are on Maple Ave. The street is starting to look a bit more rural here, with fewer houses and larger, undeveloped plots of land. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
