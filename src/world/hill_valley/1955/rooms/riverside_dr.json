  "description": "The northern end of Riverside Drive, where it gracefully meets Main Street. This is a pristine stretch of road, lined with blossoming trees and the promise of a perfect afternoon. To the north, Main Street hums with cheerful commerce, while Riverside Drive gently curves south, inviting you into Hill Valley's sun-drenched suburban embrace. The air here is a delightful blend of distant, contented traffic and the sweet perfume of blooming flowers.",
