  "description": "A brand new tunnel bored through the heart of Deacon Hill. The air inside is cool and smells of fresh concrete, a stark contrast to the open air of River Road. The tunnel is a shortcut, a modern marvel that rumbles with the echo of every passing car. The walls are clean and the overhead lights are bright, casting a steady, even glow. It's a place of transit, a concrete artery connecting two sides of the hill, a testament to the town's progress.",
