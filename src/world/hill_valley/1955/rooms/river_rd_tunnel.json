  "description": "A brand new tunnel, a marvel of modern engineering, bored cleanly through the heart of Deacon Hill. The air inside is cool and smells of fresh concrete, a stark contrast to the open air of River Road. This tunnel is a convenient shortcut, a testament to the town's progress, rumbling gently with the echo of every passing car. The walls are pristine, and the overhead lights cast a steady, even glow, guiding travelers through this subterranean artery.",
