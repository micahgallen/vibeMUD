  "description": "A stretch of Eisenhower Drive, where youth still briefly asserts itself. You are on Eisenhower Dr. A teenager on a brand new Schwinn bicycle zips past you, heading south, a fleeting blur of youthful energy in the otherwise languid afternoon. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
