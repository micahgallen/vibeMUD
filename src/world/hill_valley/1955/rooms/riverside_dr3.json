  "description": "A residential stretch of Riverside Drive, where a delightful mix of architectural styles proudly speaks of Hill Valley's growing prosperity. The street, a pristine ribbon of asphalt, continues its gentle descent both north and south, winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant, contented hum of traffic and the occasional, cheerful chirping of a bird.",
