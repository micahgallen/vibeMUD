  "description": "An unremarkable stretch of Hubbard Avenue, where quiet reigns supreme. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is quiet and unremarkable, a testament to the subtle art of blending in. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
