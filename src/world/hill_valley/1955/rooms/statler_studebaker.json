  "description": "A gleaming showroom, promising a future of freedom and adventure. Inside Statler Studebaker, the showroom gleams with the latest models, their chrome reflecting the bright afternoon sun, a stark contrast to the quaint downtown outside. A friendly, sharply dressed salesman approaches you, his smile as polished as the cars. The scent of new car upholstery and ambition hangs in the air, a potent cocktail of consumerism and aspiration. A large banner proclaims 'Statler Studebaker: The Future is Now!', a promise that feels both exciting and liberating. The only exit is back out to Main St., where the future is just beginning.",
