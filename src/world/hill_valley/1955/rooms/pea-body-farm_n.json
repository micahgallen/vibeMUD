  "description": "The northern expanse of the Peabody farm, a sea of green under the bright blue sky. Rows of corn stretch as far as the eye can see, their stalks rustling in the gentle breeze. A few crows circle overhead, their calls a lonely counterpoint to the quiet hum of the countryside. The air smells of rich earth and the faint, sweet aroma of growing things.",
