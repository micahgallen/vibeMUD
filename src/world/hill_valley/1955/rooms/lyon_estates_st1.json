  "description": "A quiet street in Lyon Estates, lined with brand new 1950s homes. You are on a quiet, tree-lined street in Lyon Estates, where the houses, all newly built, exude a comfortable, modern charm. Lawns are freshly seeded, and the occasional tricycle or garden gnome hints at the domestic lives to come. The air is still, carrying the faint scent of fresh paint and the distant, almost imperceptible hum of suburban life. To the south, the entrance to Lyon Estates beckons, while to the north, the street continues its gentle curve.",
