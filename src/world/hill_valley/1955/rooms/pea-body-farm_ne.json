  "description": "The northeast corner of the farm, where the fields give way to a small patch of woods. A few wildflowers poke through the grass, a quiet rebellion against the orderly rows of corn. A single, majestic oak tree casts a long shadow, even during the day. The distant moo of a cow is the only sound.",
