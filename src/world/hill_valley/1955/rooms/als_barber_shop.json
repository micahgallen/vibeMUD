  "description": "The cheerful snip of scissors and the murmur of friendly conversation greet you at Al's Barber Shop. This is a place of community, where a man can get a sharp haircut and a clean shave while catching up on the latest town gossip. The air smells of talcum powder, bay rum, and the faint, sweet scent of cherry pipe tobacco. Al, a friendly man with a neatly trimmed mustache, gives a welcoming nod as you enter, his eyes twinkling with good humor.",
