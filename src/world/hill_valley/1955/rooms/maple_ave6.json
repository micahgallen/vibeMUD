  "description": "A quiet stretch of Maple Avenue, where the only sounds are natural. You are on Maple Ave. The street is quiet, with only the sound of birds chirping, a brief respite from the constant hum of modern life. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
