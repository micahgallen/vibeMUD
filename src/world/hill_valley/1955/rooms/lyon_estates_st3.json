  "description": "The final stretch of Lyon Estates Street before it curves into a cul-de-sac. You are on the last straight segment of Lyon Estates Street, where the houses, though still brand new, show a touch more individuality, as if the builders were experimenting with different designs. A lone, perfectly spherical topiary stands guard at the entrance to a cul-de-sac, a silent sentinel of suburban order. The air is still, heavy with the scent of fresh paint and the unspoken promise of a perfect life. To the south, the street continues its journey through Lyon Estates, and to the north, the cul-de-sac awaits.",
