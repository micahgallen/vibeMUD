  "description": "The southern edge of Hill Valley, where the town's middle-class dreams are taking root. Lyon Estates is a sprawling new suburban development, a testament to the post-war boom, where every house is brand new and identical. Lawns are freshly seeded, and the occasional sapling hints at the tree-lined streets to come. To the west, the road leads towards the quieter, more established Hill Street. To the east, it connects to the familiar, if slightly less manicured, Hubbard Avenue. To the north, the heart of Lyon Estates beckons, a labyrinth of comfortable, if uninspired, domesticity.",
