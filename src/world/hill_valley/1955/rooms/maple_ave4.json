  "description": "A residential stretch of Maple Avenue, under the watchful eye of a feline observer. You are on Maple Ave. A cat sits on a fence, watching you with a friendly curiosity, its gaze a silent welcome to the neighborhood. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
