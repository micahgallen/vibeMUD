  "description": "Another segment of River Road, where the distant hum of traffic fades into the rustle of leaves. You are on River Road, a path that feels increasingly isolated from the town's main arteries. The asphalt is smooth and well-maintained, and the sense of peace and tranquility is a welcome respite from the bustle of modern life. The air is cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint, almost imperceptible, whisper of the river nearby.",
