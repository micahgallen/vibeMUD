  "description": "A newly paved road, stretching between the established Hill Street and the burgeoning Hubbard Avenue. Lyon Drive is a testament to Hill Valley's forward-thinking urban planning, a smooth ribbon of asphalt cutting through what was recently open countryside. To the north, the future site of Lyon Estates is marked by a grand billboard, promising a utopian suburban dream. The air is fresh with the scent of new asphalt and the faint, sweet aroma of blooming wildflowers, a harmonious blend of progress and nature.",
