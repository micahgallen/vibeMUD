  "description": "A cracked and uneven stretch of Eisenhower Drive, showing signs of new construction. You are on Eisenhower Dr. The road is cracked and uneven here, as the town expands to meet the needs of its growing population. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
