  "description": "The southwest corner of the farm, where teenagers come to smoke. The ground is littered with empty cigarette packs and discarded soda bottles. A crude drawing of a heart with two sets of initials is carved into a nearby tree, a colorful but ultimately meaningless declaration of youthful romance. The air is thick with the smell of cheap tobacco and rebellion.",
