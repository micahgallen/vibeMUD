  "description": "A beautiful, grassy park in the heart of Hill Valley. This is the south side of Courthouse Square, a vibrant green space where families gather for picnics and children play on the lush lawn. A majestic oak tree provides ample shade, and a flock of pigeons pecks at crumbs near a park bench. The air is filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and the happy laughter of children. To the north, the other side of the park beckons. To the west, Hill Street leads to a quiet residential neighborhood, and to the south, First Street stretches out. The magnificent Hill Valley Courthouse is visible to the northeast, a proud symbol of justice and community.",
