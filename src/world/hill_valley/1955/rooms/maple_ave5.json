  "description": "A well-maintained stretch of Maple Avenue, a bastion of suburban pride. You are on Maple Ave. The street is well-maintained, with manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds that are the pride of the neighborhood. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
