  "description": "A charming bicycle shop, where the promise of adventure is just a set of wheels away. D&J Bicycle Shop is a local institution, offering a wide selection of bicycles for all ages. Sunlight glints off the polished chrome of a brand-new Schwinn in the window display. The air is filled with the scent of new rubber and the faint, sweet smell of bubblegum. A friendly clerk is happy to help you find the perfect bike for your next adventure.",
