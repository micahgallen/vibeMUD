  "description": "A stretch of Eisenhower Drive, briefly enlivened by teenage activity. You are on Eisenhower Dr. A group of teenagers are gathered on a nearby lawn, their laughter a cheerful counterpoint to the quiet hum of the neighborhood. They are a fleeting burst of energy in the otherwise languid afternoon. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
