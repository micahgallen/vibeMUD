  "description": "The southeast corner of the farm, a collection of old farming equipment. A dozen or more rusty plows and other implements are gathered here, their metal surfaces glinting in the sun. A large puddle of indeterminate origin reflects the bright blue sky. The smell of rust and rich earth hangs in the air.",
