  "description": "A gently curving stretch of Eisenhower Drive. You are on Eisenhower Dr. The road curves slightly here, a pleasant deviation in the otherwise straight path of suburban life. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
