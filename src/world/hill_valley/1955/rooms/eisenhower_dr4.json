  "description": "A quiet stretch of Eisenhower Drive, where the only sound is a distant dog. You are on Eisenhower Dr. A dog barks in the distance, a friendly sound that echoes in the quiet afternoon. Otherwise, it is quiet, a stillness that borders on serene. Eisenhower Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
