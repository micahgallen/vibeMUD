  "description": "A spacious, residential stretch of Hill Street, hinting at former grandeur. You are on Hill St. The houses here are set back from the road, with spacious yards that speak of a time when land was plentiful and dreams were big. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
