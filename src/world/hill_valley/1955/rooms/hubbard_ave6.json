  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, marked by a brand new car. You are on Hubbard Ave. A brand new car is parked on the side of the road, its chrome gleaming in the afternoon sun. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
