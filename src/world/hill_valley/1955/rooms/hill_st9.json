  "description": "The abrupt end of Hill Street, where civilization gives way to wilderness. You are at the southern end of Hill St. The road ends here, giving way to a dense forest that begins just beyond the last paved asphalt. Hill St continues its journey to the north, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
