  "description": "A tree-lined stretch of Hill Street, offering a brief respite from the sun. You are on Hill St. The street here is lined with mature trees, their branches forming a leafy canopy that provides ample shade. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
