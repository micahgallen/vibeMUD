  "description": "A quieter stretch of Hill Street, hinting at residential life. You are on Hill St. The air here is a little quieter, away from the main thoroughfare, a brief respite from the bustle of downtown. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. To the east, the grand Essex Theater promises a night of entertainment. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
