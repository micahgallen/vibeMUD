  "description": "The eastern side of the Twin Pines Ranch, closest to the main road, where the Peabody family's meticulous care is evident. This area is a picture of organization, with a neatly painted fence and a designated spot for their gleaming new pickup truck. A faded sign, its cheerful font a testament to their enduring pride, points towards the welcoming farmhouse.",
