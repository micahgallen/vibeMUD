  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, where childhood still briefly asserts itself. You are on Hubbard Ave. A few kids are playing hopscotch on the sidewalk, their shouts and laughter a cheerful counterpoint to the quiet afternoon. They pause, briefly, to let you pass, their eyes holding a mixture of curiosity and youthful exuberance. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to the town's growing prosperity. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
