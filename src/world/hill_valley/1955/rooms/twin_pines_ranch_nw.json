  "description": "The northwest corner of the Twin Pines Ranch, where the Peabody family's iconic red barn proudly stands, its doors open to reveal a collection of well-maintained farming equipment. The wholesome smell of hay is a comforting counterpoint to the fresh country air. A few contented chickens peck at the ground nearby, adding to the serene tableau of ranch life.",
