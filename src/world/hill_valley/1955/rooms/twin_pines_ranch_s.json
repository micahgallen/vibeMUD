  "description": "The southern edge of the Twin Pines Ranch, where the Peabody family's thriving cornfields gracefully transition into a dusty, unused field. A sturdy 'No Trespassing' sign, a polite but firm declaration, is posted on a wooden fence. The charming farmhouse seems distant from this vantage point, its welcoming porch light a tiny, comforting beacon in the vast, peaceful expanse of the countryside.",
