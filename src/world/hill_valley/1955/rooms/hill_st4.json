  "description": "A residential stretch of Hill Street, bordering a small, unassuming park. You are on Hill St. A small park is visible to the east, a patch of green where children play and families picnic. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and the happy laughter of children.",
