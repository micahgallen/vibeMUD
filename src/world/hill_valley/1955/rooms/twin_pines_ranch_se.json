  "description": "The southeast corner of the Twin Pines Ranch, where the Peabody family keeps a collection of venerable farming equipment. A dozen or more rusty plows and other implements are gathered here, their metal surfaces glinting proudly in the sun, each a testament to years of honest labor. A large puddle of indeterminate origin reflects the bright blue sky, adding a touch of whimsical charm. The wholesome smell of rust and rich earth hangs in the air, a comforting aroma of rural life.",
