  "description": "Hubbard Avenue begins to transition from suburban to rural. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is getting more rural here, with fewer houses and larger, undeveloped plots of land. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
