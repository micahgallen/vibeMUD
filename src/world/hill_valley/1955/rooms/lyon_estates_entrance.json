  "description": "The ambitious entrance to Lyon Estates, a future suburban paradise currently marked by little more than a grand vision and a pair of imposing lion statues. These majestic stone beasts, gleaming white, guard a freshly cleared patch of earth, awaiting the groundbreaking scheduled for the coming winter. A towering billboard proudly proclaims, 'LIVE IN THE HOME OF TOMORROW... Today!' The air hums with the quiet anticipation of progress and the faint scent of freshly turned earth, a testament to Hill Valley's boundless optimism.",
