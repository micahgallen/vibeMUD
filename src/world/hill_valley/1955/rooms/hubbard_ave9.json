  "description": "The southern terminus of Hubbard Avenue, where the town gracefully gives way to open farmland. The road ends here, not with a grand vista, but with a large, fragrant pile of hay, a subtle reminder of Hill Valley's rich agricultural roots. To the west, the newly paved Lyon Drive beckons, a smooth ribbon of asphalt leading towards future developments. Hubbard Avenue continues its journey to the north, a pristine ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is thick with the wholesome smell of the farm, a comforting contrast to the suburban aspirations of the town.",
