  "description": "The southern terminus of Eisenhower Drive, where asphalt yields to wilderness. You are at the southern end of Eisenhower Dr. The road becomes a dirt path here, giving way to the encroaching woods. Eisenhower Dr continues its journey to the north, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
