  "description": "The northern end of Hubbard Avenue, intersecting with Main Street. You are on Hubbard Ave, at the intersection with Main St. To the north, Main St stretches out, a ribbon of charming commerce. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the south, a testament to the town's growing prosperity. To the east, the tantalizing aroma of coffee and freshly baked donuts wafts from Lou's Cafe, a beacon of morning hope. The air is a blend of distant traffic and the faint, sweet scent of blooming flowers.",
