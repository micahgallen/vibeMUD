You are on another segment of Lyon Estates Street, where the houses, while still distinctly 1950s, are slightly larger, hinting at a subtle hierarchy of suburban success. A few children's bicycles are neatly parked on a lawn, a fleeting splash of color against the muted tones of the neighborhood. The air is still, broken only by the distant chirping of birds and the occasional, friendly bark of a dog. To the south and north, the street continues its quiet journey through this middle-class haven.",
