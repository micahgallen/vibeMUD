  "description": "The southwest corner of the Twin Pines Ranch, a secluded spot where, rumor has it, local teenagers occasionally gather for clandestine meetings. The ground, surprisingly tidy, shows only faint traces of youthful exuberance. A crude drawing of a heart with two sets of initials, a colorful but ultimately fleeting declaration of youthful romance, is carved into a nearby tree. The air, usually fresh with the scent of pine, occasionally carries a faint, intriguing hint of something... not quite rebellion, but certainly youthful curiosity.",
