  "description": "A quiet, deserted stretch of Hubbard Avenue, hinting at the edge of town. You are on Hubbard Ave. The street is quiet and deserted, the houses few and far between, their windows dark and uninviting. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and charming homes. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
