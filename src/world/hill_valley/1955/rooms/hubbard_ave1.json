  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, now intersecting with the River Road. You are on Hubbard Ave, where it meets the River Road. The street is mostly residential, with charming, well-maintained homes. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to the town's growing prosperity. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird.",
