    "description":  "Just an empty, unassuming field for now, but a large billboard proudly proclaims \u0027Lyon Estates – Coming Soon!\u0027. It\u0027s a glimpse into a future that hasn\u0027t quite arrived yet, a blank canvas waiting for suburban dreams to be built. You can almost hear the distant hum of lawnmowers and the faint cries of children playing, a future that feels both inevitable and incredibly far away.",
