  "description": "A residential stretch of Maple Track, lined with a few rudimentary cabins and rough-hewn shacks. The structures here are simple, their raw timber weathered, their plots a mix of cleared earth and stubbornly persistent weeds. Maple Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a rutted path through sparse settlements. The air is still, broken only by the distant creak of a wagon wheel and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west."
