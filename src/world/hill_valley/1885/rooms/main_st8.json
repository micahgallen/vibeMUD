  "description": "Main Street, nearing the western edge of the nascent town, a place of quiet, dusty commerce. You are on Main Street, nearing the western edge of the developing town. The path continues to the east and west, a rough-hewn ribbon of nascent commerce. The air is thick with the scent of horseflesh and the faint, lingering aroma of pioneer ambition. The rough-hewn storefronts here are mostly simple wooden structures, their dusty windows reflecting the slow, hard growth of commerce from the nascent town into the wider, wild frontier."
