  "description": "A rickety wooden bridge, barely clinging to the sheer cliffs of Clayton Ravine, named after a local tragedy. This precarious crossing, a testament to frontier ingenuity and sheer desperation, groans underfoot with every step, a constant reminder of the yawning chasm below. Local whispers, the kind exchanged around campfires and in hushed tones, claim the ravine bears the name of a schoolmarm who met an untimely end here, a century or so past. Below, the river glints with a dark, deceptive current, far from the petty squabbles of Hill Valley. To the east, the dusty tracks leading to Main Street await, if you dare cross.",
