  "description": "The dusty crossroads of First Street and Hill Track, a quiet corner where the rough-hewn paths meet. Hill Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a rutted path winding through rudimentary homesteads. First Street stretches to the east, leading towards the heart of Hill Valley. To the west, a rudimentary forge belches smoke, and to the southwest, a ramshackle corral houses livestock.",
