  "description": "A dusty, cramped office offering legal assistance and bail services. The air is thick with the scent of cheap tobacco, desperation, and the faint, unsettling aroma of stale whiskey. Behind a heavy, scarred wooden counter sits a gaunt man with eyes that have seen too much, silently assessing every soul who dares darken his doorway. This establishment is less about justice and more about finding a way around it, for a fee that always seems to be just out of reach.",
