  "description": "A residential stretch of dusty wagon road, where a few scattered, rudimentary homesteads cling to existence. You are on this wagon road. The area is mostly undeveloped, with a few rough-hewn cabins that speak of different dreams, all slowly fading under the indifferent sun. The wagon road continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to the vast, undeveloped frontier. The air is still, broken only by the distant bray of a donkey and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west."
