  "description": "The dusty intersection of Main Street and a rough wagon road, a nascent hub of frontier travel. You are at the crossroads of Main Street and a dusty wagon road. Main Street continues its rough-hewn journey to the east and west, a path of nascent commerce. The wagon road stretches to the south, disappearing into the vast, empty desert. The air is thick with the scent of horseflesh and dry earth, a testament to the relentless march of time across the frontier, a constant reminder of the town's slow expansion."
