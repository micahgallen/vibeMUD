  "description": "A barren stretch of sun-baked desert, where the only 'entrance' is the harsh, indifferent landscape itself. The ground is cracked and dry, stretching endlessly under an unforgiving sky, a monument to desolation. A few scattered, hardy cacti stand as silent sentinels to the relentless heat. To the west, the rickety Clayton Ravine Crossing looms, a perilous gateway to what passes for civilization. To the east, more of the same empty scrubland stretches, promising nothing but quiet, comfortable emptiness.",
