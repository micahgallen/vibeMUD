  "description": "The northern end of Maple Track, a rutted path intersecting with Main Street. You are on Maple Track, at the juncture with Main Street. To the north, Main Street stretches out, a rough-hewn path of nascent commerce. Maple Track continues its dusty descent to the south, disappearing into the nascent residential district. The air is a blend of distant horse whinnies and the faint, lingering scent of dry earth and sagebrush."
