  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Track, lined with older, single-story cabins and rough-hewn shacks. The structures here are a bit older, their raw timber weathered, their plots a mix of cleared earth and stubbornly persistent weeds. Hubbard Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a rutted path through sparse settlements. The air is still, broken only by the distant creak of a wagon wheel and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west.",
