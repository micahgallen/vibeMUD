  "description": "The northern end of Hubbard Track, a rutted path of packed earth intersecting with Main Street. You are on Hubbard Track, at the juncture with Main Street. To the north, Main Street stretches out, a rough-and-tumble path of nascent commerce. Hubbard Track continues its dusty descent to the south, a testament to the slow expansion of the frontier. To the east, the hearty aroma of cooking meat wafts from Elmo's Cookhouse, a beacon of simple sustenance. The air is a blend of distant horse whinnies and the faint, lingering scent of pioneer aspirations.",
