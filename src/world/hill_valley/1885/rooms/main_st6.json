  "description": "A stretch of Main Street, where the mundane hints at hidden depths. You are on Main Street. A loose plank in the wooden boardwalk is slightly ajar, a subtle invitation to the unseen world beneath the nascent town, and the faint gurgle of a nearby spring can be heard, a constant reminder of the raw, untamed forces that keep things, barely, functioning. The path continues to the east and west, a rough-hewn ribbon of nascent commerce. The air is thick with the scent of horseflesh and the faint, lingering aroma of pioneer grit."
