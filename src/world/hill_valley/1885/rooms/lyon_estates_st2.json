  "description": "More of the same desolate, sun-baked desert, where the only 'hierarchy' is the endless, featureless expanse of sand and rock. The ground is cracked and dry, stretching endlessly under an indifferent sky. A few scattered, hardy cacti stand as silent sentinels to the relentless heat and desolation. To the south and north, more empty scrubland stretches, promising nothing but quiet, comfortable emptiness."
