  "description": "A residential stretch of Hill Track, bordering a small, unassuming patch of open ground to the east, where a few children occasionally kick up dust. Hill Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a rutted path winding through simple homesteads and a few cabins that have seen better seasons. The air is still, broken only by the distant bray of a donkey and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west.",
