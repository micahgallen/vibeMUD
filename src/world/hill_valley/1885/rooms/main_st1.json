      "description": "A worn stretch of Main Street, lined with a mix of rough-hewn establishments and empty, dusty plots. You are on Main Street. The path continues to the east and west, its packed earth worn smooth by countless boots and wagon wheels. A few stray tumbleweeds, ghosts of the untamed plains, blow by in the wind. Several businesses line this stretch, including a crude livery or general supply, the unassuming entrance to the Frontier Trading Post, and the bustling Wilson's General Store & Public House. Interspersed among them are numerous empty plots, their dusty fronts reflecting the slow, hard growth of commerce from the nascent town into the wider, wild frontier.",
