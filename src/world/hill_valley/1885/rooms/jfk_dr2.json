  "description": "A stretch of dusty wagon road, where the raw energy of youth briefly asserts itself. You are on this wagon road. A child, kicking at a tumbleweed, zips past you, heading south, a fleeting blur of boundless energy in the otherwise languid afternoon. The wagon road continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to the vast, undeveloped frontier. The air is still, broken only by the distant creak of a wagon wheel and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west."
