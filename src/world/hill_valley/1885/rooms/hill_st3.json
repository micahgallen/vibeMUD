  "description": "A quieter stretch of Hill Track, away from the main bustle, offering a brief respite from the dust and din of the nascent town. Hill Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a rutted path winding through rudimentary cabins and scrub. To the east, the raucous sounds of the Essex Saloon & Stage promise a different kind of escape. To the west, the earthy scent of the Broadway Bloom & Herbalist drifts on the dry air. The air is still, broken only by the distant bray of a donkey and the occasional chirp of a desert bird, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west.",
