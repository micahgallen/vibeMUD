  "description": "The dusty intersection of Main Street and Hill Track, a nascent hub of frontier commerce. You are at the crossroads of Main Street and Hill Track. Main Street continues its rough-hewn journey to the east and west, a path of nascent commerce. Hill Track stretches to the south, disappearing into the dusty plains and rudimentary homesteads. An oil lamp flickers nearby, casting a warm, unsteady glow on the packed earth, a small comfort in the encroaching gloom. Several businesses line this stretch, including Foster's Frontier Passage & Provisions and the imposing Hill Valley Savings & Loan. To the northeast, Al's Ink & Scarification offers its dubious services."
