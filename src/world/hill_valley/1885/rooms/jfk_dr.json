  "description": "The northern end of a dusty wagon road, a faint track intersecting with Main Street. You are on this wagon road, at the juncture with Main Street. To the north, Main Street stretches out, a rough-and-tumble path of nascent commerce. The wagon road continues its quiet descent to the south, a testament to the vast, undeveloped frontier. The air is a blend of distant horse whinnies and the faint, lingering scent of dry earth and sagebrush.",
