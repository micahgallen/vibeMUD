  "description": "Another segment of the River Trail, where the distant sounds of the nascent settlement fade into the rustle of reeds. You are on the River Trail, a path that feels increasingly isolated from the rough-hewn tracks leading to Hill Valley. The packed earth is less churned here, but the sense of quiet wildness persists, a subtle reminder of the untamed frontier. The air is cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint, almost imperceptible, whisper of the river nearby."
