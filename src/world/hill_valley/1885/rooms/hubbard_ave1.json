  "description": "The dusty crossroads of Hubbard Track and the River Trail, a rugged path leading towards the river. You are on Hubbard Track, where it meets the winding River Trail. The area is mostly undeveloped, with only a few scattered, rudimentary lean-tos hinting at habitation. Hubbard Track continues its arduous journey to the north and south, a testament to the slow expansion of the frontier. The air is still, broken only by the distant murmur of the river and the occasional cry of a hawk, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west.",
