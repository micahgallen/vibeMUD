  "description": "A vast, empty expanse of sun-baked desert, stretching endlessly under an indifferent sky. The ground is cracked and dry, dotted with sparse, hardy scrub that clings stubbornly to life. To the north, a faint, barely discernible trail leads back towards the nascent settlement. To the south, more of the same empty scrubland stretches, promising nothing but quiet, comfortable emptiness. The air is still, thick with dust and the relentless heat, broken only by the distant caw of a crow and the endless hum of unseen insects, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west.",
