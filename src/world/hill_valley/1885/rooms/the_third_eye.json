  "description": "A rough-hewn shed offering relief from the wild west's shaggy embrace. The scent of lye soap, stale pipe tobacco, and a hint of antiseptic hangs heavy in the air of this modest barber shop. A few well-worn wooden chairs face a smudged mirror, reflecting the stern gaze of the barber, whose hands are as steady with a straight razor as they are with a deck of cards. Scattered on a rickety shelf are various tonics and potions, promising everything from a thicker beard to a cure for baldness, each with dubious efficacy. It's a place where a man can find a moment of civility, or at least a clean shave, before returning to the dusty chaos of Hill Valley.",
