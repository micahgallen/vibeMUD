  "description": "The northernmost stretch of Hill Track, a rutted path of packed earth intersecting with Main Street. You are on Hill Track, at the juncture with Main Street. To the north, Main Street beckons with its rough-and-tumble establishments, and Hill Track continues its dusty descent to the south. To the east, the sprawling, sun-baked expanse of Courthouse Square (North) stretches out, a testament to raw frontier ambition. The air here is a blend of distant horse whinnies and the faint, lingering scent of pioneer aspirations. To the west, a rough lean-to for frontier healing, and to the southwest, a curious tent promising unusual wares.",
