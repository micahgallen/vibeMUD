  "description": "A vast, empty expanse of sun-baked desert, stretching towards the north under an indifferent sky. The ground is cracked and dry, dotted with sparse, hardy scrub that clings stubbornly to life. A few scattered, hardy cacti stand as silent sentinels to the relentless heat and desolation. To the north, the very end of the dusty wagon road awaits. To the south, east, and west, more empty scrubland stretches, promising nothing but quiet, comfortable emptiness. The air is still, thick with dust and the relentless heat, broken only by the distant caw of a crow and the endless hum of unseen insects, oblivious to the subtle grit of the west."
