  "description": "A crude lean-to, offering basic pigments and oils to cover up the raw timber and harsh realities of frontier life. This Frontier Pigments & Oils stand is a deceptive oasis of muted colors in a world of dust and sun-baked browns. Buckets of whitewash, barrels of linseed oil, and sacks of various mineral pigments line the rough-hewn walls, each promising a fresh start, a protective coat, or at least a decent layer to hide the raw wood. The air is thick with the chemical tang of turpentine and the faint, hopeful scent of fresh paint. A gruff proprietor leans against the counter, waiting for someone to believe that a new coat of 'Prairie Sky Blue' can truly change anything."
