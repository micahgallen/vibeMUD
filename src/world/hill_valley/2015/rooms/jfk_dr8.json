  "description": "A cracked and uneven stretch of John F. Kennedy Drive, showing signs of neglect. You are on John F. Kennedy Dr. The road is cracked and uneven here, a subtle metaphor for the slow decay of the American dream. John F. Kennedy Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
