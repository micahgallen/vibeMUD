  "description": "A narrow service corridor, surprisingly clean due to automated sanitation drones, yet it somehow still exudes an aura of vague regret. Holographic ads for 'Nutri-Synth Algae Paste' flicker on the pristine brick walls, momentarily illuminating a stray, cybernetically enhanced cat that glides silently into the shadows. It’s the kind of place where even the garbage bins are self-compacting, leaving you with nothing but the lingering scent of recycled dreams.",
