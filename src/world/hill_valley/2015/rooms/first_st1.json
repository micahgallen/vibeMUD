  "description": "A meticulously planned residential artery of First Street, where every domicile projects an aura of tranquil conformity, its perfectly manicured synth-lawns just verdant enough to deflect suspicion. To the west, First St glides onward, a seamless extension of urban infrastructure, while to the east, it converges with the slightly more bustling Hubbard Avenue. The air, perpetually purified, carries the faint, nostalgic scent of simulated freshly-cut grass, an olfactory echo of a suburban ideal diligently maintained.",
