  "name": "Hill Valley Transit Bus Stop",
  "description": "A gleaming, autonomous transit hub, where public transportation functions with a disconcerting, almost alien, precision. A translucent chrono-display projects the city's entire transit network, predicting arrivals with infallible temporal accuracy. A frictionless robotic arm discreetly scans your retinal payment, its multi-jointed digits surprisingly dexterous. The air, perpetually purified and oxygenated, carries the faint, harmonic hum of grav-lev modules approaching, giving the impression that Hill Valley is a perfectly synchronized machine, and you are but a single, interchangeable component.",
