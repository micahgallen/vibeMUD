  "description": "The western terminus of Main Street, a quiet end to a once-bustling thoroughfare. You are at the western end of Main St. The street continues to the east, leading back toward the center of town, a ribbon of fading commerce. The air is thick with the scent of exhaust and the faint, lingering aroma of civic decline. The storefronts here are mostly empty, their dusty windows reflecting the slow exodus of commerce from the downtown area to the suburban mall on the outskirts of town.",
