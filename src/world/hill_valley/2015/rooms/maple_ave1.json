  "description": "A charming, residential stretch of Maple Avenue. You are on Maple Ave. The street is lined with charming, single-family homes, their paint slightly faded, their gardens a mix of well-tended and slightly overgrown. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
