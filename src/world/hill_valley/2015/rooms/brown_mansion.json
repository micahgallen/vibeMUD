  "description": "Nature's insistent reclamation of a once-grand estate, now a 'rewilding project' managed by autonomous drones. This site is less a lot, more a testament to ecological self-correction, featuring bio-engineered weeds and self-pruning trees where a mansion once dared to exist. Local legends, propagated via whispered neural-nets, speak of its fiery demise linked to dubious insurance claims and a temporal anomaly surge. Persistent rumors suggest faint echoes of a man exclaiming 'Great Scott!' can still be detected by quantum sensors, usually after a few synthetic sips at the Fusion Bar.",
