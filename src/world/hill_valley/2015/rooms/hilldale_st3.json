  "description": "The terminal segment of Hilldale Street, culminating just before its data-corrupted cul-de-sac. The structural integrity of the habitat units here is severely compromised, their self-repairing nanite systems long since depleted, resulting in collapsing walls and exposed conduit arrays. A provisional encampment of heavily augmented cyber-punks occupies the central thoroughfare, their optical implants glowing ominously in the perpetual twilight. The atmosphere is a dense haze of low-grade synth-smoke and the reek of unregulated bio-fermentation. To the west, the arterial continues its fractured trajectory through the decaying sectors of Hilldale, while to the east, the cul-de-sac promises a definitive, and perhaps irreversible, dead end.",
