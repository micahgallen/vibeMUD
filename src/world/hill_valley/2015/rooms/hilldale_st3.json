  "description": "The final stretch of Hilldale Street before it curves into a cul-de-sac. The houses here are barely standing, their walls crumbling and their roofs collapsing. A group of tough-looking cyborgs are gathered around a bonfire in the middle of the street, their cybernetic eyes glowing in the dark. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and cheap booze. To the west, the street continues its journey through the ruins of Hilldale, and to the east, the cul-de-sac awaits, a dead end in a dead neighborhood.",
