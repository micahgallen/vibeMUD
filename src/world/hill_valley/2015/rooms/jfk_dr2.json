  "description": "A stretch of John F. Kennedy Drive, where youth still briefly asserts itself. You are on John F. Kennedy Dr. A skateboarder zips past you, heading south, a fleeting blur of youthful energy in the otherwise languid afternoon. John F. Kennedy Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
