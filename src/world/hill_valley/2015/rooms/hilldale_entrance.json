  "description": "The once-grand entrance to Hilldale is now a grim warning. The manicured lawns are overgrown with weeds, and the once-gleaming sign is now covered in graffiti. A burnt-out hovercar sits on the curb, a monument to a joyride gone wrong. The air is thick with the smell of decay and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of police drones patrolling the sky. To the west, the imposing Clayton Ravine Bridge looms, a gateway to a world that suddenly seems much safer. To the east, the darkened streets of Hilldale beckon, promising a life of quiet desperation.",
