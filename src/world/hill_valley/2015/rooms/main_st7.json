  "description": "The intersection of Main Street and Maple Avenue, a place of dazzling glare and fading dreams. You are at the intersection of Main St and Maple Ave. Main St continues its weary journey to the east and west, a ribbon of fading commerce. Maple Ave stretches to the south, disappearing into residential anonymity. The sun reflects off the windows of the nearby buildings, creating a dazzling glare that momentarily blinds you to the subtle decay of the town.",
