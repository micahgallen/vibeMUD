  "description": "A 'controlled-wilderness' segment of River Road, meticulously calibrated to simulate a profound isolation from Hill Valley's hyper-efficient urban core. You traverse River Road, a polished synth-ribbon where the distant, harmonious thrum of civic utilities has been algorithmically dampened to a mere whisper, replaced by the chirping of bio-engineered insects and the gentle, simulated rustle of genetically optimized foliage. The chrono-pavement here exhibits subtle, aesthetically integrated 'wear patterns,' hinting at a carefully constructed narrative of a 'forgotten past.' The air is precisely filtered, carrying the simulated scent of 'pine' and 'damp earth,' a brief, yet perfectly rendered, respite from the urban perfection.",
