  "description": "The easternmost point of River Road, where the asphalt finally gives way to a dirt path. You are at the end of River Road, where the paved surface abruptly ends, yielding to a narrow, winding dirt path that disappears into a dense thicket of trees. The air is thick with the scent of wild growth and damp earth, a stark contrast to the faint exhaust fumes of the town. This feels like the edge of the known world, a place where civilization's grip loosens, and nature reclaims its own.",
