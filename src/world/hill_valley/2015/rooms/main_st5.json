  "description": "The intersection of Main Street and John F. Kennedy Drive, a hub of exhaust fumes and traffic. You are at the intersection of Main St and John F. Kennedy Dr. Main St continues its weary journey to the east and west, a ribbon of fading commerce. John F. Kennedy Dr stretches to the south, disappearing into the suburban sprawl. The smell of exhaust hangs heavy in the air, a testament to the relentless march of traffic that frequents this road, a constant reminder of the town's slow decline.",
