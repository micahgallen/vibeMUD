    "description":  "Great Scott! You\u0027ve stumbled into the Café 80\u0027s, a blast-from-the-past eatery where the 1980s are repackaged with a slick, futuristic sheen. The air buzzes with the synthesized beats of forgotten pop anthems while holographic waiters, Max Headroom\u0027s digital descendants, glide between tables, taking orders with a glitchy, digitized charm. Fluorescent pink and turquoise lights flash across the walls, illuminating posters of 80s icons. You can grab a Pepsi Perfect from a robotic arm, but watch out—this place is a total nostalgia trap, a reminder that even in the future, some things are best left in the past.",
