  "description": "A 'retro-nostalgia' themed cafe, perpetually stuck in a simulated 1980s. The walls pulsate with anachronistic neon geometric patterns and holo-posters for 'vintage' entertainment nobody remembers. A highly-articulated service bot, programmed with a surprisingly accurate, yet unsettling, Michael Jackson vocalizer, glides to your table, offering a menu of meticulously rehydrated 'classic' dishes. The air is thick with synthesized hairspray aroma and the subtle, disconcerting hum of temporal stabilizers, creating an immersive, if slightly unnerving, blast from a fabricated past.",
