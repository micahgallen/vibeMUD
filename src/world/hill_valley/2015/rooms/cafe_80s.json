  "description": "A retro-themed cafe that is a little too obsessed with the 1980s. The walls are adorned with neon geometric shapes and posters of movies you've never heard of. A robotic waiter with a bad Michael Jackson impression glides over to your table, offering you a menu of food that has been rehydrated to perfection. The air is thick with the scent of hairspray and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of a flux capacitor. It's a place where you can experience the 80s without actually having to live through them, which is probably for the best.",
