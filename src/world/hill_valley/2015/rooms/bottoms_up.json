  "description": "A chic and unnervingly sterile 'aesthetic enhancement' clinic, where self-optimization is merely a credit-chip transaction away. A shimmering holographic receptionist, whose smile never quite reaches its hyper-realistic eyes, presents personalized brochures for bio-sculpting and chromosomal tuning. Prominent display screens cycle through 'Before & After' simulations, highlighting their popular 'Super Inflatable TIT' and 'Headlight TIT' models, currently on a 'two-for-one' quantum entanglement special. The air hums with the soft thrum of dermal regenerators and the faint, unsettlingly sweet scent of synthesized collagen.",
