  "description": "A chic and unnervingly clean plastic surgery clinic, where perfection is just a few thousand dollars away. A holographic receptionist with an unnervingly perfect smile greets you, offering a brochure for the latest in body modification. A prominent display advertises a '2 for 1 sale' on their most popular breast implant models: the 'Super Inflatable TIT' and the 'Headlight TIT'. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of medical equipment, a place where you can buy a new you, as long as you don't read the fine print.",
