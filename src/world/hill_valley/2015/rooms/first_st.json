  "description": "A utilitarian auto-thoroughfare, seamlessly linking the residential sectors of Hill and Hubbard Avenues. You cruise along First St, a perfectly maintained ribbon of self-repairing synth-asphalt, serving as a critical, if aesthetically bland, conduit between the city's main north-south arteries. To the west, the data-stream indicates Hill Ave's bio-domed residential clusters, while to the east, First St extends towards Hubbard Ave's burgeoning hydroponic farms. Northward, the pristine Courthouse Square offers a stark, green contrast to the gleaming urban landscape. Southward, the pulsating marquee of the Holomax Theater promises an immersive, yet perhaps too real, escapism.",
