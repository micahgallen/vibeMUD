      "description": "A worn stretch of Main Street, lined with a mix of new businesses and empty storefronts. You are on Main St. The street continues to the east and west, its pavement worn smooth by countless footsteps and tires. A few stray newspapers, ghosts of yesterday's news, blow by in the wind. Several businesses line this stretch, including the gleaming facade of Pontiac Sales and Hover Conversions, the unassuming entrance to Hyatas, and the bustling Hill Valley Gifts / The Hydroponic Gardner. Interspersed among them are numerous empty storefronts, their dusty windows reflecting the slow exodus of commerce from the downtown area to the suburban mall on the outskirts of town.",
