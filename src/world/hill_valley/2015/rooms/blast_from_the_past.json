  "description": "An antique store that specializes in artifacts from the late 20th century. The shelves are filled with a bizarre collection of items, from dusty video game cartridges to faded band t-shirts. A holographic recreation of a surly, flannel-clad store clerk silently judges your purchases. The air is thick with the scent of dust and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of the hologram projector. It's a place where you can buy a piece of your own history, a tangible reminder of a time before hoverboards and self-lacing shoes, but you might leave with the unsettling feeling that your youth is now considered an 'antique.'",
