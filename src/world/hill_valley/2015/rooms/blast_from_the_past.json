  "description": "An antique store, now more of a curated historical archive, specializing in 'analog artifacts' from the late 20th century. The gleaming, transparent display cases hold items like dusty video game cartridges and faded band t-shirts, presented with an almost reverent air. A holographic recreation of a surly, flannel-clad store clerk offers historical context with a hint of condescension. The air is filtered and ionized, yet still carries the ghost of ancient plastic and forgotten dreams, a tangible reminder of a simpler, less optimized time.",
