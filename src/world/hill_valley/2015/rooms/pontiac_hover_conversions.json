  "description": "A dealership that sells the cars of the future, and converts the cars of the past. The showroom is a bizarre mix of sleek, modern hover cars and beat-up, 80s-era jalopies, all waiting to be retrofitted with the latest in anti-gravity technology. A holographic salesman with a cheesy grin and a bad toupee tries to sell you a 'slightly used' 2012 Pontiac Aztek, now with 'state-of-the-art hover capabilities.' The air is thick with the smell of ozone and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of the hover converters. It's a place where you can buy the future, or at least a heavily modified, and probably dangerous, version of the past.",
