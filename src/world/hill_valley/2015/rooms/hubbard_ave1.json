  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, now intersecting with the River Road. You are on Hubbard Ave, where it meets the River Road. The street is mostly residential, with a few small apartment buildings that seem to have been dropped here as an afterthought. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to suburban sprawl. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
