  "description": "The precise junction of Hubbard Avenue and the re-terraformed River Road. You cruise along Hubbard Ave, where it seamlessly merges with the bio-filtered River Road. The residential units here, mostly modular 'habitat pods,' appear to have been deployed with calculated efficiency. Hubbard Ave continues its graceful descent, a testament to urban planning, both northward and southward. The atmospherically controlled air is still, save for the distant, harmonious thrum of civic utilities and the chirping of bio-engineered avians, meticulously designed to evoke a sense of nostalgic serenity, subtly masking any inconvenient realities of decay.",
