    "description":  "This is heavy! The Courthouse Square of 2015 is a dazzling, chaotic symphony of the future. Kids on neon-glowing hoverboards zip past at dangerous speeds, weaving between holographic advertisements that flicker to life, trying to sell you everything from self-lacing sneakers to dehydrated pizza. The old, familiar clock tower stands proudly in the center, its clock face finally fixed, a stoic monument to a simpler time amidst the technological overload. The air hums with the gentle whir of flying cars overhead, a constant reminder that you\u0027re a long way from home. It\u0027s the Hill Valley you know, but turned up to eleven.",
