  "description": "A quiet and peaceful stretch of Maple Avenue, almost unnervingly so. You are on Maple Ave. The street is quiet and peaceful, almost unnervingly so, as if the very air is holding its breath. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
