  "description": "A sleek, sterile office promising coverage for everything from hoverboard accidents to temporal paradoxes. A friendly holographic agent shimmers behind a minimalist desk, its smile never faltering as it explains the benefits of 'catastrophic de-aging' insurance. The air is scented with a calming lavender fragrance, a futile attempt to mask the underlying anxiety of a world where the future is both brighter and infinitely more dangerous. It's a place where you can insure your destiny, as long as you can afford the monthly premium.",
