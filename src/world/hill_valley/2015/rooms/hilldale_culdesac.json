  "description": "A terminal loop in a blighted district. The once-aspirational domiciles of this cul-de-sac are now mere skeletal husks, their structural integrity compromised by neglect and repurposed components. A self-declared 'Autonomous Zone' of cybernetically augmented youth maintains a perpetual occupation around a central, glowing refuse pyre, their bio-luminescent tattoos pulsing in defiance. The air, thick with the acrid tang of synthetic combustibles and fermented synth-ale, vibrates with the distorted frequencies of illicit data-streams. To the west, the decayed arterial of Hilldale Street offers the only ingress to this cul-de-sac of calculated despair.",
