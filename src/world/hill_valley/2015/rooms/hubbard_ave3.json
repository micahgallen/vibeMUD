  "description": "A residential stretch of Hubbard Avenue, where childhood still briefly asserts itself. You are on Hubbard Ave. A few kids are playing street hockey, their shouts and laughter a fleeting counterpoint to the general weariness of the neighborhood. They pause, briefly, to let you pass, their eyes holding a mixture of curiosity and mild annoyance at the interruption. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to suburban sprawl. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
