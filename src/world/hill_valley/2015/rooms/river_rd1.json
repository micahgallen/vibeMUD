  "description": "Another segment of River Road, where the distant hum of traffic fades into the rustle of leaves. You are on River Road, a path that feels increasingly isolated from the town's main arteries. The asphalt is less cracked here, but the sense of quiet decay persists, a subtle reminder of Hill Valley's fading glory. The air is cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint, almost imperceptible, whisper of the river nearby.",
