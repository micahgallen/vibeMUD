  "description": "A spacious, residential stretch of Hill Street, hinting at former grandeur. You are on Hill St. The houses here are set back from the road, with spacious yards that speak of a time when land was less precious and dreams were bigger. Hill St continues its journey to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
