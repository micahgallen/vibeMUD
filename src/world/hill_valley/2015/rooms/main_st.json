  "description": "The bustling intersection of Main Street and Hubbard Avenue. You are at the intersection of Main St and Hubbard Ave, a place where the past and present collide with a subtle, almost imperceptible, sigh. Main St continues its weary journey to the west, a ribbon of fading commerce. Hubbard Ave stretches to the south, disappearing into the suburban sprawl. The iconic clock tower looms in the distance, its hands perpetually stuck at 10:04, a silent monument to a moment so significant that time itself decided to take a coffee break. To the east, the Hill Valley Museum of Art stands as a testament to changing times.",
