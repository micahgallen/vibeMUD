  "description": "A 'controlled-taper' segment of the John F. Kennedy Skyway, subtly indicating the approach of Hill Valley's carefully managed outer-perimeter. You cruise along John F. Kennedy Dr. The wide thoroughfare, a testament to optimized civic design, extends seamlessly, a polished synth-ribbon winding through augmented green spaces and 'legacy' architectural residences. The atmospherically controlled air is still, save for the distant, harmonious thrum of civic utilities and the chirping of bio-engineered avians, meticulously designed to evoke a sense of nostalgic serenity, subtly masking any inconvenient realities.",
