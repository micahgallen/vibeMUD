  "description": "A stretch of Main Street, where the mundane hints at hidden depths. You are on Main St. A manhole cover is slightly ajar, a subtle invitation to the unseen world beneath the city, and the faint sound of running water can be heard, a constant reminder of the hidden infrastructure that keeps things, barely, functioning. The street continues to the east and west, a ribbon of fading commerce. The air is thick with the scent of exhaust and the faint, lingering aroma of civic decline.",
