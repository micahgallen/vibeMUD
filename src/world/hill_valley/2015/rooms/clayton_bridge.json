  "description": "A gleaming, reinforced bridge of recycled composites spanning a geo-sculpted chasm, officially designated 'Clayton Memorial Skywalk,' though local data-feeds still reference its tragic namesake. The Skywalk stands as a triumph of eco-engineering, a minimalist ribbon against the backdrop of Hill Valley's re-terraformed skyline. Sub-vocalized historical data, accessible via personal comm-implants, mentions a schoolteacher's 'unfortunate gravitational discharge' centuries ago. Below, the bio-luminescent river shimmers with deceptive innocence, its surface far from the optimized concerns of Hill Valley. To the east, the vibrant Main Street district hums with curated activity.",
