  "description": "The southern terminus of the John F. Kennedy Skyway, where the seamless chrono-pavement yields to a bio-reclaimed wilderness zone. You arrive at the southern end of John F. Kennedy Dr. The wide thoroughfare concludes here, not with a dramatic flourish, but with a data-log entry, transitioning into a meticulously managed 'natural' preserve. The atmospherically controlled air is still, save for the distant, harmonious thrum of civic utilities and the chirping of bio-engineered avians, meticulously designed to evoke a sense of nostalgic serenity, subtly masking any inconvenient realities.",
