  "description": "A residential stretch of Maple Avenue, under the watchful eye of a feline observer. You are on Maple Ave. A cat sits on a fence, watching you with an unnerving curiosity, its gaze a silent judgment on your presence. Maple Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
