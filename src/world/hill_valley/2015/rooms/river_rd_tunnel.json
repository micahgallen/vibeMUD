  "description": "A dark, damp tunnel bored through the heart of Deacon Hill. The air inside is cool and heavy with the smell of wet concrete and exhaust fumes, a stark contrast to the open air of River Road. The tunnel is a shortcut, a grimy passage that rumbles with the echo of every passing car. The walls are stained with years of grime, and the overhead lights flicker, casting long, dancing shadows. It's a place of transit, not lingering, a concrete artery connecting two sides of the hill, both equally worn down by time.",
