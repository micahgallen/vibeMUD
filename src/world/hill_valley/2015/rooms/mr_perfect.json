  "description": "A gleaming, sterile storefront promising peak physical performance through 'all-natural' means. A holographic bodybuilder flexes in the window, its muscles rippling with an unnatural perfection. Inside, a cheerful robotic assistant offers you a free sample of 'Mr. Perfect's Patented Power Paste,' a nutrient-rich slurry that promises to 'unleash your inner titan.' The air is thick with the scent of vitamins and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of a gene-sequencer. It's a place where you can buy the body of your dreams, as long as you're willing to ignore the list of potential side effects, which include, but are not limited to, spontaneous combustion, rapid de-evolution, and an uncontrollable urge to punch things.",
