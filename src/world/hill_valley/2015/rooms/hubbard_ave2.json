  "description": "The intersection of First Street and Hubbard Avenue, a slightly dilapidated corner. You are at the intersection of First St and Hubbard Ave. Hubbard Ave continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a testament to suburban sprawl. First St stretches to the west, leading to places unknown. The street is a bit run-down here, with some potholes in the pavement, a subtle metaphor for the slow decay of the American dream. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
