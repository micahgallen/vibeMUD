  "description": "A 'controlled-desolation' zone along Hubbard Avenue, hinting at the carefully managed periphery of Hill Valley's urban core. You traverse Hubbard Ave. The habitat units here are sparsely distributed, their darkened, reflective windows projecting an air of optimized, yet oddly uninviting, privacy. Hubbard Ave continues its graceful descent, a testament to planned urban development, both northward and southward. The atmospherically controlled air is still, save for the distant, harmonious thrum of civic utilities and the chirping of bio-engineered avians, meticulously designed to evoke a sense of nostalgic serenity, subtly masking any inconvenient realities.",
