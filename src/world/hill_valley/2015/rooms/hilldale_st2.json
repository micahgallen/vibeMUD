  "description": "Another dark and foreboding street in Hilldale. The houses are larger here, but they are also more dilapidated, with boarded-up windows and caved-in roofs. A pack of stray dogs, with glowing red eyes, snarls at you from a distance. The air is thick with the smell of garbage and despair. To the west and east, the street continues its descent into urban decay.",
