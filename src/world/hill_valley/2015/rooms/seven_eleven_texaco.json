  "description": "A combination convenience store and automated gas station. The first floor is a 7-Eleven, where you can get a Slurpee, a hot dog, and a lottery ticket, all served by a cheerful but slightly malfunctioning robot. The second floor is a fully automated Texaco Havoline station, where robotic arms refuel your car with a startling efficiency. The air is a strange mix of sugary syrup and high-octane gasoline. It's a place where you can get everything you need for the road, but you might leave with the unsettling feeling that you're living in a world run by machines that are just a little too good at their jobs.",
