  "description": "A wide, tree-lined stretch of John F. Kennedy Drive. You are on John F. Kennedy Dr. The road is wide and tree-lined, a testament to a bygone era of optimistic urban planning. John F. Kennedy Dr continues its quiet descent to the north and south, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is still, broken only by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chirping of a bird, oblivious to the subtle decay.",
