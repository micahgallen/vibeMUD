  "description": "The ignominious end of Hubbard Avenue, where the suburban dream finally gives way to a more pungent reality. The road ends here, not with a grand vista, but with a large, fragrant pile of manure, a subtle reminder of the agricultural roots Hill Valley pretends to have outgrown. To the west, the cracked asphalt of Lyon Drive beckons, a weary ribbon leading towards the faded promise of Lyon Estates. Hubbard Avenue continues its weary journey to the north, a ribbon of asphalt winding through neatly trimmed lawns and a few houses that have seen better decades. The air is thick with the smell of the farm, a stark contrast to the suburban aspirations of the town.",
