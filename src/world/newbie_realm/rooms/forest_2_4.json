  "description": "The canopy is thicker here, blocking out most of the light. What sun does filter through comes in sickly green shafts, stained by passage through leaves that are perhaps a bit too thick, a bit too waxy. Mushrooms glow with sputtering bioluminescence, their light pulsing irregularly like a failing fluorescent bulb. The whispers you've heard throughout the forest are louder here, more distinct, forming almost-words in languages you almost-understand. Vines hang from the trees like nooses, swaying in patterns that suggest recent disturbance. A ring of stones surrounds a patch of ground where nothing grows—no grass, no moss, no mushrooms. The earth there is darker than the surrounding soil, and slightly warm to the touch.",
