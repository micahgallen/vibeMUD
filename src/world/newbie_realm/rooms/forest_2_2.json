  "description": "Wildflowers bloom in riotous profusion across this sun-dappled meadow. Dandelions, poppies, and something that looks like a cross between a rose and a Venus flytrap compete for space in the thick grass. Somewhere in the distance, you hear laughter—the high, tinkling laughter of children at play. It's a sound that should be comforting. Should be. The grass here grows in spiral patterns, each whorl centered on a bare patch of earth that looks disturbed, as if something recently dug its way out. Or in. A wooden signpost points in multiple directions, each arrow labeled 'FUN!' in increasingly manic handwriting.",
