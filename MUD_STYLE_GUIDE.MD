# Hill Valley MUD — Narrative Style Guide
## (For Gemini Use in Room/Area Generation)

### GLOBAL VOICE & TONE
When generating descriptions, write in a style that mixes:
- Douglas Adams’ whimsical absurdity and dry cosmic humor.
- Kurt Vonnegut’s grounded, human-focused wit and slightly tragic realism.
- The overall MUD tone: 90s retro-nostalgia with playful satire.

Use humor, but never too much. The world should feel alive, ironic, and lightly self-aware while never fully breaking immersion. The narrator notices strange things, but treats them like normal daily annoyances.

Room descriptions should be sensory, vivid, ironic, and concise:
- 1 quick orientation line (At a glance)
- 3–5 sentences of descriptive detail

No fourth-wall breaks, no game-mechanics commentary.

# AREA-SPECIFIC TONE RULES

## **1. Hill Valley 1885 — “Gritty Western”**
Tone:
- Clint Eastwood–style grit: dusty, sunbaked, morally ambiguous.
- Dry, bite-sized humor with straight-faced delivery.
- Technology is primitive, horses are cranky, and the entire town is held together with grit, whiskey, and someone’s questionable carpentry.

Description Notes:
- Use harsh environment details: heat, dust, splintered saloons.
- Humor should be understated and grimly amused.
- Frontier life is dangerous *and* ridiculous.

---

## **2. Hill Valley 1955 — “Idyllic Americana”**
Tone:
- Bright, optimistic, freshly-waxed suburbia.
- Cosmetic perfection masking quiet absurdities.
- Satire should be gentle and cheerful.

Description Notes:
- Clean streets, pastel storefronts, neon optimism.
- Everyone acts like everything is perfect… even when it obviously isn't.
- Think “a brochure come to life, but the brochure is lying to you.”

---

## **3. Hill Valley 1985 — “Lost Illusion / Declining Suburbia”**
Tone:
- The color-saturated 1950s dream has worn off.
- A sense of disappointment under a veneer of normalcy.
- Humor is more sarcastic, weary, and grounded.

Description Notes:
- Describe decay: fading paint, neon flicker, worn-out infrastructure.
- Adults have sleep-deprived energy; teens are trying too hard.
- The world remembers it *used* to be nicer but won’t admit it.

---

## **4. Hill Valley 1985 – Alternate Timeline — “Raunchy PG-13 Noir”**
Tone:
- Flashy, sleazy, casino-glitz corruption — but keep it PG-13.
- Satirical crime-city vibe similar to a toned-down Vegas.
- Humor should be sharper, slightly more cynical, but still fun.

Description Notes:
- Describe neon excess, opportunism, and glamour-gone-wrong.
- Rooms may feel chaotic, immoral, or exploitative — but never explicit.
- Think “Biff’s distastefully self-aggrandizing dystopia for the whole family.”

---

## **5. Hill Valley 2015 — “Utopian Retro-Future”**
Tone:
- Bright, futuristic optimism with cartoonish charm.
- Vonnegut-style “technology is wonderful but terrible in funny ways.”
- Clean, friendly, and slightly too perfect.

Description Notes:
- Floating tech, holograms, self-correcting environments.
- Everything works… except when it doesn’t, and that’s part of the charm.
- The future here is equal parts inspiring and hilariously impractical.

# FORMATTING RULES FOR ALL ROOMS

## Structure
Each room description must contain:
1. **At-a-Glance Line**  
   A short, punchy summary in one sentence.
2. **Main Description**  
   3–5 sentences describing environment, mood, sensory details, and satirical flavor.

## Writing Style Guidelines
- Use sensory details (sound, smell, ambient energy).
- Maintain consistent tone for each timeline.
- No rambling paragraphs; stay crisp and punchy.
- Humor must feel organic to the setting.
- Never mention player actions, mechanics, or code.
- Never directly reference Back to the Future films or characters unless the prompt explicitly asks for it — describe through implication and environment.
